# Project-PainRelief-Nefopam-Fentanil
This is a experimental design on medical data and its statistical Analysis 

# Data
The dataset is from Medical data from Vietnam

# Metodology 

For this study I created a contruction validity in order to analyze the information that was given along with the requirements and possible results. To construct that validity I made some assumptions:

Kind of experiment
Hypothesis and Research question
Methodology fo the experiment
Expected results
Conclusions

To build this construction validity I implemented a backward and forward analysis taking in consideration the exploration of the variables and the results obtained in every step.
